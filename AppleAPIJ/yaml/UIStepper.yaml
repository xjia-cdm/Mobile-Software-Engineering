 title: UIStepper
 description: A control used to increment or decrement a value.
 overview: 
  description: If you set stepper behavior to “autorepeat” (which is the default), pressing and holding one of its buttons increments or decrements the stepper’s value repeatedly. The rate of change depends on how long the user continues pressing the control.
