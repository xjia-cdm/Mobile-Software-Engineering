 title: UIView
 description: An object that manages the content for a rectangular area on the screen.
 overview: 
  description: Views are the fundamental building blocks of your app&amp;apos;s user interface, and the UIView class defines the behaviors that are common to all views. A view object renders content within its bounds rectangle and handles any interactions with that content. The UIView class is a concrete class that you can instantiate and use to display a fixed background color. You can also subclass it to draw more sophisticated content. To display labels, images, buttons, and other interface elements commonly found in apps, use the view subclasses provided by the UIKit framework rather than trying to define your own.

    name: Creating a View
    description: Normally, you create views in your storyboards by dragging them from the library to your canvas. You can also create views programmatically. When creating a view, you typically specify its initial size and position relative to its future superview. For example, the following example creates a view and places its top-left corner at the point (10, 10) in the superview&amp;apos;s coordinate system (once it is added to that superview). let rect = CGRect(x: 10, y: 10, width: 100, height: 100) let myView = UIView(frame: rect)  To add a subview to another view, call the addSubview(_:) method on the superview. You may add any number of subviews to a view, and sibling views may overlap each other without any issues in iOS. Each call to the addSubview(_:) method places the new view on top of all other siblings. You can specify the relative z-order of subview by adding it using the insertSubview(_:aboveSubview:) and insertSubview(_:belowSubview:) methods. You can also exchange the position of already added subviews using the exchangeSubview(at:withSubviewAt:) method. After creating a view, create Auto Layout rules to govern how the size and position of the view change in response to changes in the rest of the view hierarchy. For more information, see Auto Layout Guide.

    name: The View Drawing Cycle
    description: View drawing occurs on an as-needed basis. When a view is first shown, or when all or part of it becomes visible due to layout changes, the system asks the view to draw its contents. For views that contain custom content using UIKit or Core Graphics, the system calls the view’s draw(_:) method. Your implementation of this method is responsible for drawing the view’s content into the current graphics context, which is set up by the system automatically prior to calling this method. This creates a static visual representation of your view’s content that can then be displayed on the screen. When the actual content of your view changes, it is your responsibility to notify the system that your view needs to be redrawn. You do this by calling your view’s setNeedsDisplay() or setNeedsDisplay(_:) method of the view. These methods let the system know that it should update the view during the next drawing cycle. Because it waits until the next drawing cycle to update the view, you can call these methods on multiple views to update them at the same time. Note If you are using OpenGL ES to do your drawing, you should use the GLKView class instead of subclassing UIView. For more information about how to draw using OpenGL ES, see OpenGL ES Programming Guide. For detailed information about the view drawing cycle and the role your views have in this cycle, see View Programming Guide for iOS.

    name: Animations
    description: Changes to several view properties can be animated—that is, changing the property creates an animation starting at the current value and ending at the new value that you specify. The following properties of the UIView class are animatable: frame bounds center transform alpha backgroundColor To animate your changes, create a UIViewPropertyAnimator object and use its handler block to change the values of your view&amp;apos;s properties. The UIViewPropertyAnimator class lets you specify the duration and timing of your animations, but it performs the actual animations. You can pause a property-based animator that is currently running to interrupt the animation and drive it interactively. For more information, see UIViewPropertyAnimator.
   - 
    name: Threading Considerations
    description: Manipulations to your application’s user interface must occur on the main thread. Thus, you should always call the methods of the UIView class from code running in the main thread of your application. The only time this may not be strictly necessary is when creating the view object itself, but all other manipulations should occur on the main thread.
   - 
    name: Subclassing Notes
    description: The UIView class is a key subclassing point for visual content that also requires user interactions. Although there are many good reasons to subclass UIView, it is recommended that you do so only when the basic UIView class or the standard system views do not provide the capabilities that you need. Subclassing requires more work on your part to implement the view and to tune its performance. For information about ways to avoid subclassing, see Alternatives to Subclassing.
