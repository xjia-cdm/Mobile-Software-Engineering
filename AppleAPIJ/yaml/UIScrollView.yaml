 title: UIScrollView
 description: A view that allows the scrolling and zooming of its contained views.
 overview: 
  description: UIScrollView is the superclass of several UIKit classes including UITableView and UITextView.
  sub_overview: 
    name: State Preservation
    description: If you assign a value to this view’s restorationIdentifier property, it attempts to preserve its scrolling-related information between app launches. Specifically, the values of the zoomScale, contentInset, and contentOffset properties are preserved. During restoration, the scroll view restores these values so that the content appears scrolled to the same position as before. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS.
