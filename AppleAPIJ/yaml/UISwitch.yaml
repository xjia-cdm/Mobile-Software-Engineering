 title: UISwitch
 description: A control that offers a binary choice, such as On/Off.
 overview: 
  description: The UISwitch class declares a property and a method to control its on/off state. As with UISlider, when the user manipulates the switch control (“flips” it) a valueChanged event is generated, which results in the control (if properly configured) sending an action message.
