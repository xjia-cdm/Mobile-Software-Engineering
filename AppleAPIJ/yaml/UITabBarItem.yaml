 title: UITabBarItem
 description: An item in a tab bar.
 overview: 
  description: A tab bar operates strictly in radio mode, where one item is selected at a time—tapping a tab bar item toggles the view above the tab bar. You can also specify a badge value on the tab bar item for adding additional visual information—for example, the Messages app uses a badge on the item to show the number of new messages. This class also provides a number of system defaults for creating items.
  sub_overview: 
    name: Customizing Appearance
    description: In iOS v5.0 and later, you can customize the appearance of tab bars by setting item label text attributes using appearance selectors declared by UIBarItem. You can also use the methods listed in Customizing Appearance. You can customize the appearance of all tab bar items using the appearance proxy (for example, [UITabBarItem appearance]), or just of a single tab bar item. By default, unselected and selected images are automatically created from the alpha values in the source images. To prevent system coloring, provide images with UIImage.RenderingMode.alwaysOriginal. For more information about appearance and behavior configuration, see Tab Bars.
