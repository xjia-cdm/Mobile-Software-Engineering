 title: UIPickerView
 description: A view that uses a spinning-wheel or slot-machine metaphor to show one or more sets of values.
 overview: 
  description: A picker view displays one or more wheels that the user manipulates to select items. Each wheel—known as a component—has a series of indexed rows representing the selectable items. Each row displays a string or view so that the user can identify the item on that row. Users select items by rotating the wheels to the desired values, which align with a selection indicator.
