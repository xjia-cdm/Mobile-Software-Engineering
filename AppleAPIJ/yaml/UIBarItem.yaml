    description: You can customize the image to represent the item, and the position of the image, using image and imageInsets respectively. In iOS v5.0 and later, you can also specify a custom image and position to use in landscape orientation when using the iPhone appearance idiom using landscapeImagePhone and landscapeImagePhoneInsets respectively. In addition, you can customize the title’s text attributes using setTitleTextAttributes(_:for:), either for a single item, or for all items by using the appearance proxy (for example, [UIBarItem appearance]).
