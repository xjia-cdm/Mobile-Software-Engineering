    name: Supported File Formats
    description: In addition to HTML content, UIWebView objects can be used to display other content types, such as Keynote, PDF, and Pages documents. For the best rendering of plain and rich text in your app, however, you should use UITextView instead.

    name: State Preservation
    description: In iOS 6 and later, if you assign a value to this view’s restorationIdentifier property, it attempts to preserve its URL history, the scaling and scrolling positions for each page, and information about which page is currently being viewed. During restoration, the view restores these values so that the web content appears just as it did before. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS. For more information about appearance and behavior configuration, see Web Views.
