    name: columnSpec
    api_level: API level 14
    api_signature: public GridLayout.Spec columnSpec
    description: The spec that defines the horizontal characteristics of the cell group described by these layout parameters. If an assignment is made to this field after a measurement or layout operation has already taken place, a call to View.setLayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams) must be made to notify GridLayout of the change. GridLayout is normally able to detect when code fails to observe this rule, issue a warning and take steps to compensate for the omission. This facility is implemented on a best effort basis and should not be relied upon in production code - so it is best to include the above calls to remove the warnings as soon as it is practical.
